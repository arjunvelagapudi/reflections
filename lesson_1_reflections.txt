How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was
introduced?

If the program was bugfree previously, the change must of created the bug. Diff shows
the change.

Manual Commits:
Manual commits allow the user to determine when changes to the repository are made

Mult-file Commits:
Multi-file Commits should only be done when the logical relationship in the change occurs
in multiple files. If the logical relationship for two different files is different, each 
should contain it's own commit.

Reflect: What is Git for?
Saving and sharing code for collaboration. 



q |    exit git log!
git log  |    List the commits and show which files have changed
git log --stat  |    Show addition information about the commits
git diff id1 id2  |    Compare two commits
git clone  |    Create a local copy/clone from the repository
git config --global color.ui auto |    get colored diff output
git checkout  |    Shows a previous version of the file. This is not a checkout to edit like in SVN or TFS!
